# DOS with gas limit

Denial of service with gas limit is often caused by a lack of understanding of how the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) works, resulting in the contract being exploited or the contract cannot operate expectedly.

It can be occure when there is unbounded loop inside function call. At some point of time the loop will be longer enough that that function can not be executed withing the block gas limit and the contract will go `out of gas` every time.

#### Example

````solidity
 function applyInterest() external onlyOwner returns (uint256 minBankBalanceRequired_) {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < userAddresses.length; i++) {
            address user = userAddresses[i];
            uint256 balance = userBalances[user];

            // Update user's compound interest
            userBalances[user] = balance * (100 + INTEREST_RATE) / 100;

            // Calculate the minimum bank balance required to pay for each user
            minBankBalanceRequired_ += userBalances[user];
        }
    }
```
